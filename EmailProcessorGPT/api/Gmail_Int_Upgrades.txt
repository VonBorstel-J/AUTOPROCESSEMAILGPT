    # Adjust the return value to include attachments_info
    return {'sender': sender, 'subject': subject, 'body': email_body, 'attachments': attachments_info}



Step 4: Update Database Schema to Store Attachment References
Modify your database schema to store the URLs or identifiers of the attachments instead of the binary data directly. This could be a new column in your Email table or a separate table if emails can have multiple attachments.

Step 5: Adjust Application Logic Accordingly
Ensure your application logic that interacts with email attachments is updated to work with external storage references. For instance, when accessing an attachment, your application should now retrieve it from the external storage using the stored URL or identifier.

Final Notes:
Security: Set appropriate permissions for the stored files. If they contain sensitive information, you may not want them to be publicly accessible. Configure access controls according to your security requirements.
Performance and Costs: Using external storage can impact performance and incur costs. Monitor usage to optimize for performance and manage expenses effectively.
Backup and Redundancy: Ensure your external storage setup includes strategies for backup and redundancy to protect against data loss.







FUTURE PLANS FOR DATA MASKING (DYNAMIC)

Types of Data Masking
Static Masking: Replacing sensitive data with fictional but realistic data. For instance, names could be changed to "Person A" or "User 1", and specific numbers like social security numbers could be replaced with a generic format like "XXX-XX-XXXX".
Dynamic Masking: This method involves masking data on-the-fly as it's requested or processed. It's particularly useful in real-time systems where data needs to remain functional.
Redaction: Completely removing the sensitive part of the data. Unlike static or dynamic masking, redaction leaves blanks or removes entire sections of text, which can sometimes impact the utility of the data for AI processing.

Implementing Data Masking for Email Processing
Identify Sensitive Information: Determine what constitutes sensitive information in your emails. This could include names, addresses, phone numbers, financial details, health information, or any personally identifiable information (PII).

Choose a Masking Strategy: Depending on your specific needs and the nature of the data, decide whether static masking, dynamic masking, or redaction is most appropriate. For emails, static masking before processing might be the simplest and most effective approach.

Apply Masking Rules: Develop and apply a set of rules or algorithms to replace or obscure the sensitive information. This could involve regular expressions to find patterns of data (like phone numbers or email addresses) and replace them with generic placeholders.

Process the Masked Data: Once the data is masked, it can be safely sent to the AI tool (like GPT) for processing. Since the sensitive information has been removed or obscured, there's no risk of it being exposed outside your secure environment.

Reintegrate Processed Data: After processing, the AI-generated summaries or extracted information will be based on the masked data. This processed data can then be integrated back into your systems or workflows.

Benefits of Data Masking
Privacy Protection: Ensures sensitive information is not exposed to external systems or third-party tools.
Compliance: Helps in complying with data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, etc., by ensuring that only necessary data is processed.
Security: Reduces the risk of data breaches by minimizing the exposure of sensitive information.
Challenges and Considerations
Data Utility: Excessive or improper masking can reduce the utility of data, making it harder for AI tools to generate meaningful insights.
Complexity: Developing effective masking rules requires a good understanding of both the data and the processing needs.
Accuracy: Masking needs to be accurately applied to ensure no sensitive data slips through, which requires thorough testing and validation.
Implementing a data masking process, especially when dealing with AI tools like GPT for processing emails, represents a proactive step towards securing sensitive information while leveraging advanced AI capabilities for data analysis and automation.
